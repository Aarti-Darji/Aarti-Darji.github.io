Hello! I'm an 3rd year undergraduate majoring in Data Science with a concentration in Psychology and minor in Mathematics at The University of Texas at Arlington. My interdsiciplinary background has introduced me to a diverse range of research areas. I'm particularly interested in designing on-body sensors and wearables to measure different bio-physiological responses for cognition. I've also been interested in fabricating silicone textures that can enhance a user's haptic perception when interacting with user interface. 

Another area I'm interested in is medical image analysis via deep learning frameworks. I've worked with Histopathology and Multiplexed Immunofluorescence by compressing them into latent space representations and comparing these different modalities to find similarities in morphological structure and visualize protein expression. 

I've been fortunate to be be advised by [Jacob Luber](https://luberlab.org/) and [Cesar Torres](https://hybridatelier.uta.edu/).
