Hello! I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Arlington with my major in Data Science with a concentration in Psychology and a minor in Mathematics . My interdsiciplinary background has introduced me to a diverse range of research areas. My research interests include mutlimodal representation learning for multi-omics and non-omics datasets for retrieval and fusions tasks. I'm also interested in developing visualization tools single cell datasets for exploration and interpretation with the support of Agentic AI.

My previous research experience involved designing on-body sensors to measure different bio-physiological responses and silicone composite layers to motivate unique gestures. 

I've been fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Luber](https://luberlab.org/), [Cesar Torres](https://hybridatelier.uta.edu/) and [Nils Gehlenborg](https://hidivelab.org/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
