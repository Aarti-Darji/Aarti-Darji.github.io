Hello! I'm an 3rd year undergraduate majoring in Data Science with a concentration in Psychology and minor in Mathematics at The University of Texas at Arlington. My interdsiciplinary background has introduced me to a diverse range of research areas. I'm particularly interested in designing on-body sensors and wearables to measure different bio-physiological responses for cognition. I've also been interested in fabricating silicone textures that can enhance a user's haptic perception when interacting with user interface. 

Another area I'm interested in is medical image analysis via deep learning frameworks. I've worked with Histopathology and Multiplexed Immunofluorescence by compressing them into latent space representations and comparing these different modalities to find similarities in morphological structure and visualize protein expression. 

I've been fortunate to be be advised by [Jacob Luber](https://luberlab.org/) and Cesar Torres(https://hybridatelier.uta.edu/).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
